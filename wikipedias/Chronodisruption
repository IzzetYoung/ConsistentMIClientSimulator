Chronodisruption is a concept in the field of circadian biology that refers to the disturbance or alteration of the body's natural biological rhythms, for example the sleep-wake cycle, due to various environmental factors. The human body is synchronized to a 24-hour light-dark cycle, which is essential for maintaining optimal health and well-being. However, modern lifestyles —which involve exposure to artificial light (especially during nighttime), irregular sleep schedules, and shift work — can disrupt this natural rhythm, leading to a range of adverse physiological outcomes. Chronodisruption has been linked to a variety of health disorders and diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, mood disorders, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Such disruptors can lead to dysregulation of hormones and neurotransmitters, though researchers continue to investigate the physiological implications of chronodisruption. Indeed, research in chronobiology is rapidly advancing, with an increasing focus on understanding the underlying mechanisms of chronodisruption and developing strategies to prevent or mitigate its adverse effects. This includes the development of pharmacological interventions, as well as lifestyle modifications such as optimizing one's sleeping environment and timing of meals and physical activity.
