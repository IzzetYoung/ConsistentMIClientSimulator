Caregiver burden is the stress which is perceived by caregivers due to the home care situation. The subjective burden is considered to be one of the most important predictors of negative outcomes from the home care situation.  The concept of caregiver burden was introduced in the 1960s, distinguishing between objective and subjective aspects of caregiving. Objective burden arises from specific caregiving tasks, while subjective burden typically stems from the emotional strain caused by the excessive demands and potential embarrassment associated with caring for recipients. Various other terms, such as caregiver role fatigue, spousal burnout, and role engulfment, are also used to describe this phenomenon. Despite the variation in terminology, these terms consistently depict a situation where caregivers lack sufficient physical and mental resources to meet the needs of the care recipient. This burden is not solely related to the actual duties imposed by care recipients but is shaped by the emotional context of the caregiving situation and the availability of resources.
