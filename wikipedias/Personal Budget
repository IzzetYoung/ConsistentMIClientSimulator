A personal budget (for an individual) or household budget (for a group sharing a household) is a plan for the coordination of income and expenses.  Personal budgets are usually created to help an individual or a household of people to control their spending and achieve their financial goals. Having a budget can help people feel more in control of their finances and make it easier for them to not overspend and to save money. People who budget their money are less likely to amass large debts, are more likely to lead comfortable lives in retirement, and are better prepared for emergencies.
