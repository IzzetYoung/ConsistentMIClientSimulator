So there are lots of places around that have it. Your local senior center would have it. And what I recommend is that you start by doing it in a chair. Just sitting in the chair.", "I could?", "You could. You can talk to the instructor and that way you won't fall, you'll feel confident and you'll start to learn some of the moves. And then gradually over time, as you get a little bit better at doing the moves in a chair, you can start to stand up, use the chair to lean on, and then eventually, you'll be able to get to the point where you can do it on your own.", "And you really recommend this?", "You know, it cuts your risk of falls in half. It also helps to reduce pain although that's not a short-term benefit, you do have to stick with it for at least three to six months to start have it help reduce your pain.

My life is too much in turmoil.", "So I get the impression that there are some things that you're concerned about, but that overall, coming in here wasn't necessarily the first thing that was on your mind when you came to the hospital with your daughter. Um, so can you tell me, what was it that made it possible for you to even come in? What-what were some of the things you were thinking about?", "I think it's important because I've-- I feel I'm a bad role model for my children, and my daughter's turning 12, and already, some of her friends have tried smoking, so I don't want her to think it's a good thing.", "So the last thing you'd want is for your daughter to start smoking.", "I smoked when I was young, and I certainly don't want it for her.", "Hmm. And it sounds like your smoking, setting an example, those are some things that-that you're also, uh, a bit concerned about, um, but as you said earlier, not-not really ready to put down your cigarettes immediately.", "Well, that's true. It seems so hard. I'm just not ready for this right now.", "So Sandra, what's good about smoking? What do you like about it?", "It's very enjoyable, relaxing, you know, a stress reliever. When I'm at work, we all go out and smoke and chit chat and, you know, talk about things. I would hate to not smoke, really. I'd be left out.", "What else? Tell me what else is good about it.", "Hmm, I like to have a cigarette after I eat. It sort of tells my brain I'm finished, stop eating, I'm full. So it's a- it's a way to-- you know, sometimes I'll have a cigarette instead of a snack, so it's a way to control my weight.", "Okay. So is there anything else that you like about it?", "Let me think. Well, I just enjoy it. I think it's, uh-- it's not good for me, I know, but I'm so used to smoking. I don't really think about quitting too much.", "So let me make sure that I understand all of the good things about smoking, the things that you like about it, and let me know if I've missed anything or left anything out.", "Okay.", "So it sounds like it's a way to relax. It's a way to socialize with your friends from work, and it's hard to imagine what it would be like for you at work if you couldn't go outside and smoke.", "That's true. Yeah.", "You also mentioned that smoking is a way to manage your weight, and concern that if you were-were going to quit smoking, what that would do in terms of, um, gaining weight, and that smoking after meals is pleasurable, that it's something that would be really hard to give up.", "Yeah.", "I also heard that it's very much a part of your life. It's something that you've done for a really long time and almost impossible to think about yourself as a non-smoker. Does that capture, for you, some of the good things or things that are keeping you smoking?", "Exactly.", "So I'm hearing there are some things you really like about smoking. What about the other side? Can you tell me about some of the not-so-good things?", "Well, I-I'm worried about my children. I feel like I'm being a bad parent, and um, I often wonder, you know, they've seen me smoke for years. I certainly don't want my 12-year-old daughter to start smoking, and some of her friends are already smoking.", "Sandra, can you give me an example of a time that you did something that you think left an impression on your daughter or set a bad example for her?", "Yeah, just this morning, I was outside having a cigarette, and then when I looked up, there she was looking out the window watching me smoke.", "So this morning, that experience, it really brought home how she does watch you, and she does really look up to you and notice what you do. How did that feel when you looked up and saw her watching you?", "I felt terrible, you know, I was projecting-- I wanna be a good parent, and I don't feel this really is part of the plan.", "And again, thanks for your honesty in talking about this. I appreciate that this is a- this is a tough topic. This is a-a hard behavior to think about giving up. Um, I guess one thing that- one thing that doesn't make sense to me is that, you know, on the one hand, you talk about how being a good parent is your highest priority, it's really important to you to set a good example for your daughter-", "Mm-hmm.", "-um, and on the other hand, I'm hearing you say that smoking is important in terms of stress relief, socializing, and it's something you can't imagine ever changing. How do those two things fit together?", "It doesn't fit, you know. It's the opposite side of the coin. You know, I love to do it, but I don't think it's right.", "So what would it take for quitting or changing your smoking to be something that was more important, that raised it up in the list of priorities for you?", "I can't think of anything right now.", "Okay.", "I don't have any plans to quit. It's just something I'm thinking about.", "So, it's-it's not so much that you don't wanna quit in a way, it's almost, \"How could I do it that would work for me?\"", "Exactly.", "Okay. I appreciate. We've- we've probably used up the time that we have. I would love to see you next week if you'd be willing to schedule another appointment and talk with you more about this. Is that something that would be helpful?", "Oh, sure. Sure, I'll come in. Yeah.", "Okay. So I hear-- [crosstalk]", "We can talk about it some more.", "[chuckles] Not necessarily the-the most exciting thing for you to do, but I appreciate you are willing to do that. Can I also ask you to do a little bit of homework between now and next week? I promise it's not too time-consuming. Um, we have a booklet that we like to give folks who are just thinking about changing, who aren't sure that this is something that they're ready to do, and one of the exercises is to write down your top three reasons for change, why you would even consider quitting smoking. And then to reflect on some of the good things as we talked about, as well as some of the less good things about quitting and about continuing to smoke. Is that something you'd be willing to do over the next few days?", "Okay, okay, I'll give it a try.", "Okay, here you go.", "Thank you.", "So thanks for coming in, Sandra.

And I-I was surprised. 12:00-12:00, that's basically when the party starts, but I told her whatever-- I thought- I thought to myself that I'll-I'll come-- I'll figure out to delay her, can you pick me up later? So later, so she-- I promised that-- She dropped me off, I promised her no alcohol, no nothing. So I-- we go, I have fun like I've been having. And I was drinking. And then the time- the time came for her to pick me up. And as soon-- I couldn't delay her from picking me up. And as soon as she picked me up, and I stepped in the car, she said, \"You drank vodka.\" And I'm like, I-I didn't know what to say. I just looked at the floor. And I-I feel terrible because I-I betrayed my mother. I broke my trust with her that she expected me not to indulge in alcohol. And that's exactly what I did.", "So, here you are. You're an honors student. You're a star athlete. You've, kind of, been doing everything you've been told for all these years, and maybe last month sometime, you started getting more involved in the party scene.", "Right.", "And it was fun at first. But now you're already noticing some consequences.", "Yes, right. Like I've been noticing I've been more lethargic and apathetic towards schoolwork.", "Mm-hmm.", "I haven't really-- I kind of just sit in class like-- I-- my mind is elsewhere, especially on the weekends, where instead of-- I was- I was instead of studying, I caught up with my friends, trying to find where we can-- I get alcohol based on their age and stuff like that.", "It's really changed your focus. What do you like about drinking?", "I don't know. It-It's because I'm a very reserved person, for the most part, not when- not when I'm dealing with sports or like-- you know, like a social environment. I tend to keep to myself because I'm very self-conscious, I would say. And when I- when I drink, I feel, I don't know, like, it relaxes me. I'm able to talk or engage with other people more easily. I don't know it just", "So, it helps you, kind of, loosen up, feel more relaxed.", "Exactly.", "Sounds like you're noticing quite a few not so good things about alcohol though your mom got mad at you, you're having decreased focus, you're, kind of, not doing so well in school, maybe-", "Kind of.", "-or any other things?", "Just different groups, friends or groups, girlfriends, like different people that I'm hanging out with because certain people are associated with that type of scene. So, that-that-that's also changed.", "So, your-your friends that you were hanging out with, there's a little tension there now.", "A little bit because not all of them are into that. So, like, I'm in one group of friends, and I would talk to another person that's an another group of friends and they just happen to invite me to that first party.", "Mm-hmm.", "So, since then, I've been hanging out more with them, getting to know them. But I can also see that oh, I'm just living life, I guess. But that's also not fair to them that I'm not there for them as much as I was before.", "Okay.", "As they are there for me, you know.", "Well, given that you've sort of noticed all these changes where it's affecting your friendships, it's affecting your studying, it's affecting your relationship with your mom. Where do you think you should kind of go from here?", "Oh, um, I feel I should st-stop. I mean, like, I'm not-not unrealistic. I understand that situations like this will happen.", "Mm-hmm.", "It's just up to me not to take it so far, where I can't remember the night before, if I'm puking. All I remember is the toilet-", "Mm-hmm.", "-that's-that's not worth it, either. And I have to slowly build back my trust with my mother because that was that's a big blow. It's little so I guess may seem to other people. But to me then it's a big thing.", "Your mom is really important to you.", "Of course.", "And how she feels about you is important to you.", "Exactly.", "How important is it to you to make, uh, an adjustment in your drinking or even to quit?", "A lot at this point because I feel that's a big factor with gaining back my trust with my mother.", "Okay.", "And also getting back on top of my school work again my athletics too.", "Okay.", "So I feel that there-there's a future in that.", "How confident are you that you could actually change your drinking or-or even cut down or quit?", "I'm pretty confident, especially.", "O-on a scale of 1 to 10 where one is not at all 10 is completely what number would you give.", "Probably like an 8 or 9.", "Okay.", "And that can't be a ten there's nothing as ten in life I feel. Like there's too many factors but I feel like I'm determined to.", "Why did you say eight or nine rather than six or seven?", "Because I don't know I feel deter-determined to-to make sure this happens because I don't like how I felt after I-I betrayed my mother. I don't like remembering that the feeling of like vomiting.", "Mm-hmm.", "It's not a pleasant experience. Uh, it's not something that I wish to enjoy. So like even if I do drink, I don't want to drink to the point where that happens, like all the fun that I have and prior to that just it's not worth-it's not worth drinking.", "All right, what do you think's a realistic goal for you then?", "To make sure I have my studies. Well first, try to get-get back my trust with mother then just focus on my studies. Then if I have time for leisure time like I'll go party with my friends and just be as a party with them doesn't mean I have to drink. And I do one cup is not going to do anything to my life either. But I'd prefer not to do that. I prefer just make sure.", "So your goal is kind of to do not drink at all or if you are at a party, uh, a maximum of one at the very most.", "Exactly. Just so I take part with the social convention but it's not.", "Yeah. Chris, I really appreciate you talking with me about this. I know it seems like something that's been on your mind as it is and, you know, like I said I really care about you as a student and an athlete and want what's best for you. So I'm glad we were able to talk about this. It really seems like you have a good plan going forward, you know, really striving for not drinking alcohol at all and if you find yourself in a situation where there's alcohol, making sure to have that limit of one drink maximum. It sounds like something that will work for you.", "And-and thank you for listening me listening to me. It means a lot to me.", "It's my-- yeah it's my pleasure.

Thank you for letting me know that you're smoking again and-and, um, I also appreciate the fact you're taking so many measures to protect your son from secondhand smoke. Can I give you some advice on how you could protect him, even the- even further?", "Yeah, sure.", "So, my sense is that you're smoking and you're minimizing hi-his exposure by not smoking in the same room and smoking near windows. Is that-", "Yeah.", "-correct?", "Exactly.", "So what I would recommend then, is to move your smoking outside completely. As a smoker, the ideal situation for a smoker in the house is if their home can be made smoke-free and the smoking is moved entirely outside, especially while he's experiencing this cold.", "Yeah, well, you know that sounds okay. While he's sick, I might be able to smoke outside in the next couple days or so, but the thing is, usually I'm craving a cigarette the most when I have a glass of wine at the end of the day. I put Jake to bed, I open up a bottle and I pour myself a glass and I'm finally able to unwind, so, I get a craving for a cigarette, so, I'm not sure long-term I'd be able to smoke outside.", "Okay, so, what I'm hearing you say is that, it sounds like a feasible short-term plan, not ideal and not comfortable because what you really enjoy is that cigarette with a glass of wine, kicking back up on the sofa and chilling out perhaps while you're watching TV. And to maintain that long-term outside smoking outside in Canadian winters where it's cold and snowy, not realistic.", "Yeah, exactly and another thing is that sometimes in the morning, after I've had a couple of glasses of wine, I kinda feel tired or groggy or low on energy, so, even that I'm not sure is completely relaxing. Especially if I've had a cigarette the night before, I always feel so bad.", "So, on the one hand I'm hearing smoking and drinking at night as a way to chill out but at the same time the next day, you're not feeling so great.", "Exactly.", "Would it be helpful to give you some information on low risk drinking guidelines?", "Sure. I've never heard of them.", "Okay. Well, Hailey, what they suggest is that women don't have more than one to two standard drinks a day or a total of nine standard drinks in a week. How does that fit for you?", "Well, usually I'm having more than two glasses but if you're saying that's gonna minimize some risk and I guess some of the grogginess I'm feeling the next morning, then maybe I should just try and have one glass of wine in the evenings?", "So, it sounds like you'd be open to reducing as a way to still enjoy the wine but perhaps alleviate the way you feel in the morning, some of the hangover effects that sounds like you're experiencing.", "Yeah, I-I'd absolutely maybe reduce. I'll try my best to reduce, but I'm not sure about the smoking.", "Okay. So, you're gonna try to reduce the drinking, not sure about the smoking, what the plan is but I think we did agree upon earlier that you would move it outside, at least while he's sick?", "Yeah. I think that sounds okay.", "That's okay. All right and, um, I guess we'll see you next week for Jake's six-month checkup. Is there anything else we could talk about that might be helpful?", "No. I think just talking about it was helpful, you know, and I'm- I'm glad you've given me some information. Maybe just this week I can think about it a little more, you know, I-I feel pretty overwhelmed right now. There's so much to do. My days are pretty full, so, maybe I can just s-sit on it for a week.", "Sure, of course, Hailey a-and again I really appreciate your openness and honesty about letting me know what's going on with, you know, the stress levels and coping and drinking. I just had a thought that there's also a good mom's group, we run out of our center. So if you'd like a referral to that or some information, I'd be happy to give you and while you think about it, if you want to, um, talk about this further with one of my colleagues, I'd be happy to make you an appointment.", "All right.

Does that pretty much sum up--?", "Yeah. Yeah. I-I'm just, I don't want to lose her or my family over smoking.", "I get the feeling that your relationship is really important to you. That you would do anything.", "Well, yeah, I mean, we've been married over 25 years, and uh, we've never had any major problems. Like this is-- this is the first problem. I don't even really see it as a problem cause we used to both smoke and I was trying to accommodate them by smoking outside, but it's feeling like we're going like this and I'm just concerned, like if this keeps going, like.", "So, it strikes me that the way that we're talking about it, it's like it's all or nothing. Either you keep smoking the way you are, things continue to go downhill and get worse, your wife gets more and more on your case, or you put your cigarettes down starting the moment you walk in the door tonight and never pick them up again. It's almost like one or the other. It strikes me that as well there might be some middle ground here that it took you a long time to learn how to be a smoker and maybe it's going to take some time to learn how to stop smoking.", "So, I can actually do it that way like gradual taber?", "There are some medications and some different approaches that we can use that aren't so abrupt.

I noticed that you said that you drink two to three times a week, drink three or four drinks at a time when you do drink, and weekly, um, have more drinks than that. So six or more drinks, it says on here.", "Mm-hmm.", "Does that sound realistic?", "Yeah, uh, on the weekends?", "Okay, okay. I just wanted to let you know, I'm a little bit concerned about your level of drinking. We know that excessive drinking can make problems worse or can actually cause health problems at times, and I was just wondering if you thought about the connection between your drinking and things like the anxiety and the insomnia that you came in with today?", "No, I guess I haven't really thought much of it. Um, you know, I don't really think I drink that much in the first place-", "Mm-hmm.", "-so I have a hard time believing that it's causing my anxiety.", "Mm-hmm.", "In fact, on the nights when I don't drink, I-I have a harder time going to sleep.", "Well, you're not alone, a lot of people think that drinking helps them sleep better, and in reality, drinking might make you fall asleep faster, but it has what's called this rebound effect, and this rebound effect means that you wake up, may, might wake up in the middle of the night or early in the morning and have a hard time falling back asleep.", "Well, I, yeah, I guess I do have abo-about 2:00 AM, I tend to wake up on the nights I drink too much.", "Mm-hmm. Well, I just wanted to just show you this little chart here. For your age as a male, you're drinking more than those at a low-risk level. Um, the low-risk level for men under 65 is no more than 14 drinks a week and no more than four a day. And, in this case, a drink is considered 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or an ounce and a half of distilled spirits. And you're right, you're not drinking as much as some people out there. The way you answered our questions here, you're actually falling in the high-risk category, the risky or hazardous category, category two.", "Jeez, no. I didn't think I was that bad.", "That's why it's helpful to look at this and give some perspective. On a scale of 1-10, what is your readiness to change, 1 being I don't want to change at all, and 10 is I really want to change?", "I don't know. I mean, this is all news to me. I've, I don't want to do anything to put myself at risk and I've always thought of myself as a pretty healthy guy. I guess I'd put myself right in the middle of the five.", "Well, that's great. That's halfway there. What kept you from just giving it a one or two, something lower?", "Well, you know I'm training for the marathon, and that's why I'm coming in, is because I need to be able to get my sleep back on track, but I also don't think of myself as a hazardous drinker, and I'm certainly not an alcoholic. So, that's-that's why the middle-ground, five.", "Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, that's a good place to start. So, I heard you say your health is important, and you're getting ready to run a marathon, so you wanna be able to do what you can to make that successful. And you also were a little bit surprised that you fell into this risky or hazardous category.", "Yes.", "Okay. So, based on all that information, what are you willing to think about doing to change right now?", "Well, I-I think the natural thing would be to cut back a little on my drinking.", "Mm-hmm. So, what would that look like for you?", "Mm, um, you know, I-I guess drinking no more than maybe three or four times a week, and-and on the weekends, which is when I would drink the most, cup back to no more than five or six beers.", "Okay, okay. Well, sometimes when people aren't ready to make changes like this, it helps if they write down their goals, it gives them a chance to see them in black and white. If you were to look at this little form here and figure out where you want to go with your drinking, what would you put down as your goal?", "Um, doing the math, I guess no more than 18 drinks a week.", "Okay. So that's an improvement. So you're headed in the right direction. I do wanna let you know that with 18 drinks a week, you're still falling above this low-level risk category, and that it would be my recommendation that at some point you would fall below into this 14 or less a week.

It makes me feel relaxed.", "And you also checked that sometimes you forget things when you drink.", "Yeah.", "What kind of things do you forget?", "Um, I forget how many drinks I've had like when a friend asks me or I forget whose house I'm at.", "Sometimes you forget where you're at.", "Right.", "Here's the part where I share information. The safest level of drinking for teenagers is zero drinks. That's because we know a number of negative things are more likely to happen when adolescents drink. We know alcohol can harm how the brain develops as an adolescent and teens who drink are more likely to hurt themselves by accident. Sexual assault is another thing more likely to happen and so are sexually transmitted diseases. I'm curious, do you think your drinking has anything to do what the possibility of having an STD?", "Um, yeah. I was drinking the last time I had sex. Um, the guy had been drinking too, and we didn't use a condom.", "Do you remember giving consent when you had sex?", "Yeah. We've had sex before and we've used a condom before.", "How do you think drinking alcohol affected using a condom this time?", "Well, we just didn't stop to put one on. We weren't thinking that way.", "Sounds like drinking changes how you think in those moments?", "Yeah. I would've definitely told him to put on a condom if I was sober.", "There's something else I wanna share. When people forget where they are or how many drinks they've had, that's a sign of heavy drinking. And when people keep drinking despite experiencing negative consequences, that can be a sign of what we call alcohol use disorder.", "Well, that's not me. I don't need help from anyone.", "I'm curious. What do you like about drinking alcohol?", "Um, well, it's fun. I like drinking when my friends are drinking too. Um, I laugh more. It's just fun.", "Okay. And what about your drinking do you not like?", "Um, I don't like forgetting where I'm at sometimes.", "Anything else?", "I really don't want any STDs.", "Right. So, on one hand, you like the feeling of being relaxed and having fun when you're drinking and on the other hand, you don't like forgetting where you are or forgetting how many drinks you've had and you don't like putting yourself at risk for STDs?", "Yeah.", "So, when you think about what you like and not like about your drinking, where do you wanna go from here? What would you like to change about your drinking?", "Well, I definitely don't want to drink too much again.", "How ready are you to not drink too much? If I asked you to pick a number on a scale of 0 to 10, and 10 being totally ready, what number would you pick?", "Um, a nine.", "Very ready to stop drinking too much. Why do you think you picked such a high number like nine rather than a lower number like a six or a seven?", "Well, I really don't want any STDs and I don't like wondering whether I have one or not.", "Okay. What plan could you come up with to make sure you achieve that goal?", "Um, well, I wanna count my drinks so I don't have more than two and I want to stop drinking once I start feeling drunk.", "Great. Who could help you reach this goal?", "Well, I have this friend who thinks I drink too much. She would probably be willing to make me promise not to have more than two drinks at a party.", "Okay. And how about unprotected sex? It sounds like you don't want to experience that again.", "I'm going to talk with him and I'm gonna make him promise that we always use a condom and that we don't have sex drunk.", "All right. So, you're very motivated to change your drinking and you have a plan to keep from drinking more than two drinks at parties and keep from having unprotected sex.

It's really nice to see you again. If you remember last week, we looked at your results here and you've got impaired glucose tolerance and you were a bit worried about type two diabetes, your blood pressure and your cholesterol are up a bit too. So today, we're meeting up to talk through some of the things that you could do for yourself that might improve the situation. And as you know, there's all sorts of things can affect your health. So can we just have a bit of a general chat, but how are you getting on?", "Well, I suppose you're gonna give me a row and tell me it's all self-inflicted and I've got to change my ways and give up the things I enjoy.", "Actually, I'm not going to do that because you're the boss. It's up to you what you want to do with you about your own health.", "The doc said I've got to take pills for the rest of my life.", "You don't seem too happy about that.", "Well, I feel fine, but the-the doc said it could save my life.", "Well, there's a lot of things you can do yourself that will improve the situation as well. So what we can do today is wee up some of those things, smoking, diet, exercise, weight, loss, all those kinds of things. So we're just gonna start and see how you feel as we go.", "Okay, what should I do first?", "Well, it's very much up to you, you're the boss of your own life. Where would you like to start?", "Where do you think I should start?", "Well, I could give you my opinion. Um, and I can give you lots of information, but I think you know the score pretty well. And I think you'd know what I would say.", "Yeah, uh, you tell me, stop smoking and lose weight and take more exercise, wouldn't you?", "Absolutely. Spot on. So stopping smoking would have a huge impact, that would have a big impact very early on. Losing weight would also have a big impact because that would help with your blood pressure, your cholesterol, and also lower your diabetes risk. So what-what'd you think about those things? Uh,", "Uh, I loved to lose weight but it's so hard giving up the things you enjoy.", "It's really tough. It's hard to know where to start, isn't it?", "I really should do. Or shouldn't I,", "How important is it for you then to lose weight?", "Well, I'd like to see my children settled and my grandchildren growing up and I should,suppose I should be an example to them.", "So can it be in there for your-your family's important to you?", "Yes. I want to be there for them, but not a burden to them.", "Yeah. So w-where do you think you can start with that?", "Uh, I've been thinking about them a lot lately, and I want to be there for them. So have to do what I need to, to improve my health.", "What's kind of the first thing you might think about doing?", "You know, to start with, I could cut down on my drinking. Um, that's adding to my weight and to my blood pressure, isn't it?", "Yeah. That would be a really good place to start, mm-hmm.", "In fact, I think I'll try and cut out the booze altogether. My wife says I drink too much at the weekends.", "So I think it should be really supportive of that then.", "And I suppose I could cut out the crisps and pies at works.", "So what would you do to make sure you didn't get hungry at work?", "I'm gonna start having soup at lunchtime. I suppose a big bowl of soup would be far better than two pies.", "Yeah. Well, a big bowl of vegetable soup. You could probably count that as one or maybe even two of your five a day. So it'd be a really good place to start. Anything else you could think about doing?", "Well, there's one, one thing uh, I've done already, I've stopped adding salt to my food. The doc said that would help with my blood pressure.", "Well, that's good. That's probably benefited you already. And the other thing you might not be aware of is that salt intake is linked to loss of calcium from our bones, which makes the bones more fragile. So reducing your salt intake will really help with that too.", "Well, I didn't know that. Um, it's good to know. I'll tell my wife, um, she's still very fond of her salt and her mother had osteoporosis.", "So well, maybe you can help her as well and that would be good. Well, I think you've got off to a really great start, Mr. Green. You're very well aware of what you-you need to do, and you've obviously thought about it and got some good plans in place. So you're going to reduce your-your alcohol intake, you've already started by reducing your salt intake. Um, perhaps when we meet up next time we could talk a little bit about smoking and exercise as well, when you're ready for that. So how do you feel now?", "I feel if I go ahead and do as I say with cutting down on the pies, the crisps, um, and cutting out the booze, I feel I'm making a start but let's take it a step at a time and see how it goes. But, uh, the next day when we look at it, the figures might be a lot better.", "That's great. So should we meet up at the same time next week then?", "Yes, that's fine with me.", "That's great.

I-I guess, well, the big thing would be like kind of where I drink so like drinking like if I'm only like in my apartment so thenI'm not risking myself to drive or like if I- if I go out to a party waiting till, like, I'm 21 to drink.

I'm interested in hearing your thoughts and sharing some information with you, and what you do with that information is totally up to you. You've got a lot going on. You're a mother, you're working, you're going to school, and our healthcare team wants to make sure that you have all the resources available to you to meet your goals, including good health. And my job as your healthcare provider is to listen to you and to share information with you, including healthcare concerns associated with smoking and alcohol. Would that be okay with you?", "Yeah, I guess.", "Okay. Well, we do know that an increase in smoking and alcohol is associated with certain kinds of cancer; colon cancer, cervical cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, and, um, also pancreatic cancer. It's also associated with liver and lung disease as well as heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. So that's a lot of information, but I'm-", "Yeah.", "-interested in what your thoughts are, Sarah.", "Well, I-I'm just kinda surprised because, I mean, I don't smoke or drink that much. And I mean, compared to people I work with, you know, I-I smoke a lot less, and I feel like I've actually been trying to keep it pretty low.", "So you're consciously trying to cut back.", "Yeah.", "I have a readiness ruler in my pocket here, 0 means not ready to stop smoking at all and 10 means absolutely ready to stop smoking. Where do you see yourself on that scale?", "Um, maybe like a five.", "About a five. So you're halfway there. So why did you choose a five rather than a four?", "Well, I mean, you brought up some kinda scary stuff like, you know, cancer risk or other things like that. And you know, being a mother, I-I don't want something to happen to me obviously.", "Right. Well, that's a lot of information to think about. So given, the fact that these healthcare concerns are a possibility, and that you're worried about your family and you certainly have goals you want to succeed at, where are you in your consideration to making a change? In other words, what steps would you consider taking for this number to move closer to a 10?", "Well, I mean, I could maybe try to cut back in the evenings a little bit.", "Okay, great. Let's quantify that a little bit. So how many cigarettes would that be?", "Well, right now, if I'm having like five or six, I could try to smoke three in the evening plus, you know, still the couple during the day.", "Okay. So you-- that's cutting back quite a bit. That's a big step. So since we're kind of running out of time here today, I'm wondering if we could-- would be willing to come back in about four weeks to review this plan?", "Yeah. Sure.", "Okay, good. So we can go over your laboratory results at that time, as well as review your plan. Now, would you like some information on smoking cessation?", "Yeah, I-I think that would be very helpful.", "Okay. Well, I've got a brochure here and this has-- it's a really good brochure. It has some distraction techniques in it in case you get those nicotine cravings. So it's-", "Mm-hmm.", "-been helpful, um, in-- with patients before. I'd also like to ask you, would you be willing to see one of our counselors?", "Well, what-what for exactly?", "Well, Dr. Kirtley is one of our counselors and he is an expert in-- at discussing the association between alcohol and stress. I want to share something with you. The National Guidelines recommend that women have no more than seven drinks of alcohol per week to-to stay at that low risk level, to avoid the healthcare concerns that we spoke of earlier.", "Mm-hmm.", "You've indicated that your alcohol consumption is a bit higher than that, putting you at risk. So that's why I asked if you'd be willing to talk to Dr. Kirtley.", "I mean, I would like to talk about, you know, my stress, but I'm still not sure with the whole drinking thing.", "Certainly, certainly. I'm glad you're willing to talk to him. So before you leave here today, we'll, uh, stop by the scheduler's desk and make an appointment for you to see me back in four weeks, as well as the appointment with Dr. Kirtley. And that way, before you leave, you're all set. So do you have any other questions for me, Sarah?", "I don't think so.", "Okay. Well, it's very nice to meet you.

From this, uh, drinker's pyramid over on this side of the card, you can see that the-the score on your screening sheet shows that you're up in the harmful category of drinkers. So that it's likely you're drinking, you know, in quantities probably more than about 90% of the folks who come in to see me here at the clinic.", "Well, I know my drinking has increased a little since I got divorced and moved to Portland, but I-I don't think it's that much of a problem.", "It doesn't feel like a problem to you right now, yeah.", "No, not really.", "Yeah, okay. And then the other thing I should mention, Jill, um, drinking more than these quantities, it's-it's possible it could be pushing your blood pressure up a bit, and I'm wondering if that might be affecting the difficulty we're having getting your blood pressure down right now.", "I didn't realize that drinking had anything to do with blood pressure.", "Mm-hmm. Yeah, it can sometimes.", "Oh, well. Well, then I guess that could be a problem.", "My perspective as a doctor, it would be good if you could think about cutting back a little bit or doing something different about your drinking.

So on a scale of 0 to 10, 0 being not ready at all to do that and 10 being very ready, where would you lie on that scale?", "I'd probably a 6.", "Okay. Okay, so that sounds-- I think that's great. So why would you be up at a six and not down at a two level? What kinds of thing would push you to be there?", "Well, I didn't realize that drinking was related to my blood pressure problems. I did fall earlier this year on my home from the bar and hurt my shoulder. I don't think the drinking made me fall, but it probably didn't help the situation. though my son keeps telling me that I'm drinking too much, and it's scary to think that my drinking is harmful. It's a big word.", "Yeah. Yeah. So you've got some good reasons to try to cut back a little bit.", "Sounds like it to me.", "Yeah. And it sounds like you're willing to maybe try not going to the bar quite as much and maybe drinking a little bit less when you go to the bar.", "I think I can try to do that, yeah.", "Okay. So to what levels do you think you could do that? Where-where would you wanna go with your drinking?", "I guess I could use those numbers, and I can't make any promises, but I could try to drink less than three in a night and less than seven in a week.", "Okay. Okay.", "That mean I can only drink two or three times a week.", "Mm-hmm. So you'd drink maybe just a couple of times a week and maybe a little bit less on each occasion? Is that what you're saying?", "Like I can try that, yeah.", "Okay. Okay.", "I don't think I need to quit, but I think I can try to cut down.", "And you think you're-you're able to cut down to those levels of no more than seven a week?", "That's what I'll shoot for.", "Okay.

I've tried to quit smoking. I've had, uh, I've taken pills, I've taken the patch.", "Mm-hmm.", "I've gone through therapy. Uh, nothing's helped. I finally- I went to the doctor. I was actually in the hospital. They took me to the hospital for a week. That's the longest I quit.", "Right.

Let me just step back a little bit and ask you a question so that I can better understand where the difficulty that you're having with is.

It was on television.

I know when I've got that package in my pocket, or I know if there- if I'm going through some stress, I say, \"Oh, well, I'll have a cigarette and think this out.\"", "Sure. So, Jean, I want to make sure that I've understood what you've told me of what you find good about smoking. So it helps you calm down. It gives you something to do. It's been part of your image. You know, you feel sophisticated. You feel like a movie style. In fact, the way you talk about it, it seems like that's what it makes you feel like. Is that right?", "That's right.", "Okay.

And it's so easy to go out and take a break and have a cigarette.", "I-I never thought of it that way, but probably you're right.", "You've told me what is good about smoking for you. Uh, can you tell me what is not so good about smoking for you?", "Well, it's bad for my health and it's scaring me 'cause I don't feel well.", "Mm-hmm.", "I haven't felt well for a while. I'm getting coughing fits even when I'm on the telephone with customers.", "Is there anything else that's not good about smoking for you?", "Um, it's expensive, really got expensive, and I smoked 30, 40, sometimes 50 cigarettes a day. And I'm starting to buy different makeup 'cause I'm starting to really age, starting to get lines in my face and wrinkles and my skin is getting really clogged up and I'm spending a fortune on cosmetics.", "Okay. So let me make sure I've understood this piece as well. So the not good things or the not so good things about smoking for you are the effects on your health, effects on your physical appearance and how you'll look and-and-and the amount of investment that you're making in makeup and getting your nails done, et cetera. And then the cost of smoking.", "Yes.", "So-so let me ask you this, given everything going on in your life right now on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is the most important thing to do, and 1 would be the least important thing to do, how important is it for you to quit smoking?", "It's for me, for my health, and for the money and everything I've said, I would say it's 10 or- out of 10 that I should quit smoking.", "Definitely most important.", "Yes. A hundred percent, one of the most important things.", "Let me ask another question and follow up to that. Again, given everything going on, where 10 is the most confident you've ever felt about anything and 1 is the least confident, how confident are you that you will be able to quit?", "Um, I, I'd say 35 or 40% competent.", "35-40%. Okay.", "Yeah. I'd like to say more, but, um-", "Okay. Now, help me understand why you said 40 and not something like 10 or zero because you mentioned that you don't even want to quit.", "Well, I'm- I guess I'm still a fighter, and I-I-I- it's starting to- I'm starting to realize it and I do feel pretty good that I came to see you. I-I- it was a step and a couple of people who care about me actually, uh, gave me a pat on the back that I came to see you. So this was a big step. So I guess, yes. Um, it wouldn't have been as high maybe last week.", "Okay. So you said 30 to 40%. What would it take to build that confidence to about 45%?", "Maybe if I could come to see you again, or maybe some ideas were suggested, maybe if there was a group or something. I-I don't know, but I-I need some help.", "So if you got help, that would help you say that you went from 40% to 45%.", "I-I think so because I feel a little better that I just came to see you today.", "Okay.", "Discussing things helps me. I always feel better when I get things out.", "Okay. So Jean, I really want to congratulate you on taking this very important first step towards addressing this problem that you've had for such a long time, but as the first small step, I wonder whether you'd be open to actually just monitoring your smoking for the next week. And the reason why I say that- because as you were mentioning to me, smoking is so automatic for you that sometimes writing it down helps make every cigarette a conscious act. And I noticed that you were saying to me, you feel a loss of control over these cigarettes. And sometimes just being mindful and writing something down will help you get some control over what you're doing. And that's often the first small step. What are your thoughts about that?", "In other words, think about it more, don't- don't just do it automatically.", "That's correct. And writing it down helps that process.", "Yeah, yeah. I think so because, um, when I get the urge, I could maybe fight it and, um, maybe wait till the next urge and maybe mark that down that, uh, I didn't go right away when something went wrong. Um, yes, I-I can try that.", "Okay. And I can give you a little card that can help you keep track of it. And if you can bring that back to the next appointment, it could be something we could discuss. Okay.

So Jean, I really want to congratulate you on taking this very important first step towards addressing this problem that you've had for such a long time, but as the first small step, I wonder whether you'd be open to actually just monitoring your smoking for the next week. And the reason why I say that- because as you were mentioning to me, smoking is so automatic for you that sometimes writing it down helps make every cigarette a conscious act. And I noticed that you were saying to me, you feel a loss of control over these cigarettes. And sometimes just being mindful and writing something down will help you get some control over what you're doing. And that's often the first small step. What are your thoughts about that?", "In other words, think about it more, don't- don't just do it automatically.", "That's correct. And writing it down helps that process.", "Yeah, yeah. I think so because, um, when I get the urge, I could maybe fight it and, um, maybe wait till the next urge and maybe mark that down that, uh, I didn't go right away when something went wrong. Um, yes, I-I can try that.", "Okay. And I can give you a little card that can help you keep track of it. And if you can bring that back to the next appointment, it could be something we could discuss. Okay.

No.", "The amount you smoke is so miniscule you can't even imagine that it would cause any harm and yet here it is damaging the roof of your mouth.", "Well, we've-- you have a point there.

Um, I like the peach flavor [unintelligible 00:02:32] they're so cute. But that's really only pretty recently.", "Uh-huh. So smoking has kind of become a big part of your social life now.

Um, I am smoking on a daily basis.", "So aside from that social aspect, what are the things you like about it?", "Well, it's relaxing and it's just nice to be with people, um. Um, and you know, when, you know, I like to go to Las Vegas, and so when we go to Vegas, it's really fun to go to the cigar bars, is kind of sophisticated and fun and so, you know, it's mostly a social thing.", "Okay.", "I wouldn't say I was a chain smoker.", "Okay. How about the other side? Have you noticed any not-so-good things about the smoking?", "Well, I was going to ask you about, um, whitening my teeth because I've noticed that they have more stains on them up than a few years ago, and so I imagine that has something to do with the smoking.", "Yeah. So we're noticing some pretty negative effects in terms of your oral health with the smoking. Are there any other things that you're concerned about?", "Um. Well, there's the expense, you know. Wi-with the economy and all, um, I- I have to be careful about my money and so, um, there is the extra expense of if I'm buying more of them than I used to. So the-the money aspect is also a concern.", "Mm-hmm. So there's your oral health, there's the financial aspect, and then e-earlier you brought up some concerns about smoking cigarettes and how that can be harmful for you.", "Oh, yeah.", "Were you aware of the fact that smoking these little cigarillos, the Swisher Sweets, can have some of the same negative health effects?", "Oh, absolutely not. I mean I thought of it more as a- a fun thing to do with my friends, certainly not a smoking habit or anything that would be harmful.", "Mm-hmm. So it's kind of surprising to you that something you've been doing and you've been doing more and more of it is actually pretty bad for you.", "Oh, yes. I checked the box on your form when you asked if I use tobacco, I checked \"No,\" because I never thought of myself as a smoker.", "Mm-hmm. What do you kind of make of that now that you realize that you're actually a tobacco user and that you might actually be causing some pretty se-serious health effects.", "I'm really concerned, I mean, I don't want to, um, develop cancer, lung cancer, or any of the awful things that happen from smoking, and, you know, really, until this conversation, I never really thought of myself as a smoker at all. So I'm very concerned.", "Well, the good news is in terms of the nicotinic stomatitis, at the point in which you stop smoking, you can actually reverse all the negative effects that occurred and you might also know that you can stop the progression of any other diseases that had started, just by quitting smoking.", "Really?", "Yeah. Is that something you'd be interested in?", "Oh, I would. I really would because, like I said, I'm a brand new smoker. I didn't know I was a smoker until I came to see you.", "Mm-hmm. Well, if you think about it on a scale of 1 to 10 where 1 is really don't think you could do it at all and 10 is really confident that you could quit if you tried, where do you think you fall?", "Oh, I think I will probably be in seven or eight. I'm-I'm pretty confident that I could stop doing this.", "Okay, what made you choose seven or eight as opposed to a-a five?", "Because it's not a part of my daily life. I don't have to have, uh, a smoke when I get up in the morning. I don't smoke 20 or 30 of them a day, so it's not that much exposure and I-I feel pretty confident that I could stop.", "Mm-hmm. So, it sounds like just to kind of summarize, you've noticed some negative effects of the smoking, you have some concerns about health effects that could occur, there's the financial aspect, and yet you feel pretty confident that you could quit if you tried.

It's some damage to the roof of your mouth that happens from tobacco smoking and so I'm wondering if you can tell me a little bit how-- about how tobacco fits in your life right now.", "Tobacco. Well, I don't smoke cigarettes. I've never smoked cigarettes. I do go out with my friends. Um, you know, we go out to bars and, you know, we'll have a few drinks and smoke some of those little cigarillo-type things. I mean I wouldn't even think of them as cigars and they're certainly not cigarettes. Um, and I mean I'll have one or two of those in an evening with, uh, with my friends but certainly not 20 or 30 of them a day like you would with cigarettes and that's the only thing that could possibly have anything to do with tobacco.", "So you've made a decision in your life not to smoke cigarettes, that's something you didn't want to do. It sounds like you're kinda concerned about the health effects of cigarettes. But you have been smoking the little cigarillos at least one or two every time you go out.", "But that's- that's just like a- a social thing. That's something that my friends and I do. We-- We-- It's not habit or something that I have to have and, you know, talking about one or two when we go out for an evening. Not packs of them.", "Yeah, so you're not-- You're not like those chain smokers, you're not smoking packs and packs a day.", "Oh, no. No.", "The amount you smoke is so miniscule you can't even imagine that it would cause any harm and yet here it is damaging the roof of your mouth.", "Well, we've-- you have a point there. Mm, now that you mention it, um, I have started having one or two at work, you know, when we have break since I have a couple of friends at work that smoke and so every time we have a break, you know, we all go out to the- the break place outside, um, and so I- now I go with them and I have one of these Swisher Sweets. Um, I like the peach flavor [unintelligible 00:02:32] they're so cute. But that's really only pretty recently.", "Uh-huh. So smoking has kind of become a big part of your social life now. When you go out, you're smoking, and even during breaks at work, you're smoking.", "Well, yeah, yeah. You know now that you say it like that it's true. Um, I am smoking on a daily basis.", "So aside from that social aspect, what are the things you like about it?", "Well, it's relaxing and it's just nice to be with people, um. Um, and you know, when, you know, I like to go to Las Vegas, and so when we go to Vegas, it's really fun to go to the cigar bars, is kind of sophisticated and fun and so, you know, it's mostly a social thing.", "Okay.", "I wouldn't say I was a chain smoker.", "Okay. How about the other side? Have you noticed any not-so-good things about the smoking?", "Well, I was going to ask you about, um, whitening my teeth because I've noticed that they have more stains on them up than a few years ago, and so I imagine that has something to do with the smoking.", "Yeah.

So there's your oral health, there's the financial aspect, and then e-earlier you brought up some concerns about smoking cigarettes and how that can be harmful for you.", "Oh, yeah.", "Were you aware of the fact that smoking these little cigarillos, the Swisher Sweets, can have some of the same negative health effects?", "Oh, absolutely not. I mean I thought of it more as a- a fun thing to do with my friends, certainly not a smoking habit or anything that would be harmful.", "Mm-hmm. So it's kind of surprising to you that something you've been doing and you've been doing more and more of it is actually pretty bad for you.", "Oh, yes. I checked the box on your form when you asked if I use tobacco, I checked \"No,\" because I never thought of myself as a smoker.", "Mm-hmm. What do you kind of make of that now that you realize that you're actually a tobacco user and that you might actually be causing some pretty se-serious health effects.", "I'm really concerned, I mean, I don't want to, um, develop cancer, lung cancer, or any of the awful things that happen from smoking, and, you know, really, until this conversation, I never really thought of myself as a smoker at all. So I'm very concerned.", "Well, the good news is in terms of the nicotinic stomatitis, at the point in which you stop smoking, you can actually reverse all the negative effects that occurred and you might also know that you can stop the progression of any other diseases that had started, just by quitting smoking.", "Really?", "Yeah. Is that something you'd be interested in?", "Oh, I would. I really would because, like I said, I'm a brand new smoker. I didn't know I was a smoker until I came to see you.", "Mm-hmm. Well, if you think about it on a scale of 1 to 10 where 1 is really don't think you could do it at all and 10 is really confident that you could quit if you tried, where do you think you fall?", "Oh, I think I will probably be in seven or eight. I'm-I'm pretty confident that I could stop doing this.", "Okay, what made you choose seven or eight as opposed to a-a five?", "Because it's not a part of my daily life. I don't have to have, uh, a smoke when I get up in the morning. I don't smoke 20 or 30 of them a day, so it's not that much exposure and I-I feel pretty confident that I could stop.", "Mm-hmm.

Yeah, if it's, uh, you know, if it's been a couple of days like I can go two days, three days tops before I start to feel really sick.", "What does that feel like?", "Uh, geez. Yeah, I mean, it's the obvious stuff like my stomach feels sick, I get the body aches, uh, cold, hot, chills. Uh, everything hurts. Everything is in extremes. My emotions are in extremes. Uh, yeah, it sucks. I don't want to do anything. I just want to stay home and just stay in bed.", "That sounds awful. What do you do when that happens?", "Yeah, I mean, I start to use, I get loaded.", "Okay. How else does injecting heroin impact your life?", "Uh, you know, I get loaded and I-I can- I can function. I can go to work and, you know, do normal things, you know. Uh, I mean, there's been maybe just a couple of times where I wasn't feeling all that well, and I, uh, I was late a couple of times to work or it might overslept from the night before or whatever, but it's about it. Uh, I just want to avoid getting sick right now. That's my main priority.", "Yeah. You want to stay healthy. I'm curious, what do you like about using heroin?", "Um, well, you know, I like the way it feels. Um, you know what I mean? When I shoot up my anxiety, goes away, my depression goes away. Uh, things that usually make life really difficult, uh, get a lot easier.", "And what about your use do you not like?", "Uh, yeah. I mean, I think everybody who uses at least has some concern of overdosing on some level. Right? Uh, so that's something I'm concerned about is accidentally overdosing. And, uh, yeah, I mean, I don't want to get an infection in my arm, you know, just the usual things. I have a hard time hitting veins sometimes, and I gotta dig around a little bit and I would get worried about, you know, hitting something that I shouldn't or, you know, getting infections.", "Mm-hmm. So on one hand, using heroin feels like an escape from things you don't want to think about. On the other hand, it puts you at risk for an overdose in infections.", "Yeah, that's right.", "So weighing what you like and don't like about your use, where do you want to go from here? What do you want to do differently?", "I don't know.", "Well, some patients who inject heroin are interested in a medication called Suboxone. It reduces cravings, withdrawal symptoms without making you high. Some patients want information on how to inject drugs more safely or where to get new syringes. Other patients want to carry Naloxone which is a drug that can prevent one from overdosing.", "Uh, are you talking about Narcan? Is that the same thing?", "Yes.", "Yeah, I got some of that already. I got it from the needle exchange.", "Where do you keep it?", "Uh, at home mostly.", "In case you see someone overdosing?", "I mean, that's a concern, of course, right? Uh, I'm on the app just in case somebody nearby is OD-ing and I can get pinged. But no, mostly I just keep it in case I overdose, uh, and, uh, I'm realizing now I have it but I haven't told my roommate about it so", "Your housemate may be willing to give you Narcan if they see you overdosing.", "Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.", "Anything else you want to do about your use?", "I would really like a little bit of information on, uh, injecting in my arm.", "Okay. I can email you some information on how to inject in a way that reduces the chance of infection and we also have behavioral health specialists in our clinic who can go over how to reduce harm with you. I bet the syringe exchange has similar resources too.", "Okay.", "So it sounds like you have two goals right now. You want to tell your housemate about where you keep the Narcan in case you overdose and you want some information on how to inject safely?", "Mm-hmm. Yeah.", "How confident are you to do these two things? On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 meaning not ready at all and 10 meaning very ready, what number would you pick?", "I'd probably say 10.", "Okay. You're very ready. Why do you think you picked a 10 instead of a lower number like 8?", "Well, uh, I don't want to have an overdose and I don't want to get an infection. Seems like easy things to do.", "What kind of plan could you put in place to make sure you meet these goals?", "Um, well, I can talk to my housemate tomorrow night. I'm pretty sure that he doesn't work tomorrow night so he'll be around.", "That's great.

You mentioned you looked up some articles and it sounds like evidence is really important to you. So, um, those articles, is that something recent? Um, you can tell me about that.", "Like, uh, I don't like- have like a bibliography or anything. So I can't really- I don't really know when those were published. It's just stuff I've found, supporting the way that I look at it.", "So you felt like, um, the information that you found supports the values that you have of being able to be independent and autonomous, to be able to make your own choice and the information that your doctor shared or spoke to you about, and then this brochure kind of feels like that's challenging sort of your values.", "Yeah. Well, it's like all this brochure is saying is that, um, the same again, the same thing that I've heard, that the limits and that there is no safe amount of drink during pregnancy, but it's like, why not?", "Mm-hmm.", "You know, it's kind of like the \"why\" that it's like I never get that information", "Wha-what's the big deal if you're drinking and", "Yeah, like what kind of issues would that cause if any?", "Maybe we can kind of put that on the shelf for a moment, and we'll come back to it and sort of look at, you know, what is- what does the guidelines have to say about why. And, um, and-and I'm wondering if we can kind of just have a look for a moment at, um, your pregnancy, and is this something that you were- you were hoping to have a baby?", "Yeah.", "That was something that you'd been planning?", "Yep.", "Okay. And I'm wondering as far as, um, bringing the baby into the world and, you know, your future as a parent, ho-how important is it to have a healthy baby to you?", "Um, well, it's-it's really important to me. That's a big priority of mine is to have a healthy baby and bring him or her up well and-and, you know, be a good parent.", "Mm. What does being a good parent look like? Tell me more about that.", "Um, not-not like being there at home with them, not being absent, um, taking care of them, feeding them, um, changing their diaper, which I'm not excited about. Um, you know, kind of the- those basics.", "Hmm. Kind of like protecting your baby and guiding your baby and you know, nurturing that baby is really important to you. and raising your baby well?", "Yeah, of course.", "That's something that- that really matters to you and, um, I'm-I'm hearing you say that, you know, protecting your baby is important to you and at the same time, um, kind of clashes with some of the information that's in the brochure.", "Mm-hmm.", "What do you make about that- what do you think about that?", "Um, well, I just don't know- I just don't know where-where these brochures get their information or-or anything from, like, where's the hard evidence essentially.", "You wanna see it in black and white.", "Yeah.", "You wanna know that it's the latest and the greatest kind of thing. Um, this is information that, uh, that I have been sharing with you earlier, this is the latest information evidence-based, um, on the latest research since 2011 and, um, a lot of research has gone into what is-what is okay for a mom to consume, like, alcohol. There's the-the evidence that we have, um, but in the end, you choose what's best for you and what's best for your baby. What are your- what are your thoughts on that?", "Um, well, it surprises me that that's based on research from out of 2011, um, and I must have missed that. I guess, you know, if it is, um, you know, I do wanna do what's best for my baby and for myself. And if I have to quit drinking, um, I guess ultimately I have to-I make that decision, um, but, um, that's a lot of, uh, information to take in today.", "Mm-hmm, kind of feels like, you know, you were making some really good decisions about your baby. You've done research and you wanna be able to bring your baby up well and take care of your baby. And I-I can see that that's really important to you. I hear you saying that and it kind of feels like this information isn't kind of what you were expecting to hear.", "Nope.", "What would you feel like would be helpful as far as next steps, like when you think about maybe moving away from drinking alcohol throughout the rest of your pregnancy?", "Um, well, first things first, if I could take a brochure home maybe, um, you know, show it to my partner and-and-and get-get their support, um, I think that's really gonna help me, and kind of changing our-our habits, or, you know, putting the alcohol away, out of sight. Um, I think that's probably the best thing I can do, like, today when I get home.", "Mm-hmm, that's some really significant steps you're talking about. You're talking about putting the alcohol away, that's huge. That's-that's really big steps.", "Yeah.", "I really want to thank you for, you know, exploring this with me today, and I'm wondering if we can kind of continue this conversation again, and talk about those steps, and how it goes with talking to your partner about giving up drinking and, um, the- giving you a chance to do some more research and, you know, maybe looking through these brochures and kind of just coming back and sharing a little bit more about, you know, what you thought about the information and what feels right for you. Is that something you'd be open to?", "Yeah, I think that- I think that would be a good idea, and maybe you could help me, yeah, with, like, ways to approach it because I think that my partner kind of has the same view that I- that I had.

I did, uh, research on some of the potential side effects and some of the health problems that can result from taking steroids and I-I just don't want her to take those at all. I don't want her exposed to them at all. And then, uh, let me just go ahead and lay this out right now. Uh, because I'm sure it'll come up, but I-I do smoke. But I make sure that I do not smoke around her so that I make sure that it does not affect her. So-", "Okay.", "-I just want to let you know that right off.", "Well, it sounds like you care about Sarah a great deal. You-you don't want her, uh, using steroids. You're worried about what kind of effects those would have on her and you're- you're working hard to keep your smoking away from her so it doesn't affect her asthma.", "Mm-hmm. Yeah.", "Okay. Uh, would you mind if we talked a little bit about the chronic inhaler and the medicine that you're concerned about with, you know, the steroids because, you know, I certainly don't want her using a medicine that has steroids in it, like the ones that you're worried about for athletes. Uh, can we talk about that just a little bit?", "Yeah.", "Okay. Even though, uh, even though this medicine isn't the-the medicine that's in this is in the same broad family as the steroids you're worried about, and those are called anabolic steroids.", "Okay.", "Which build people up and have masculinizing effects.", "Mm-hmm.", "If-if I can draw an analogy-- Again, even though this medicine is in the same family as those big broad-broad family. If I could draw an analogy, a grape and a watermelon are in the same family of fruits, you know, and obviously, grape is much smaller than a watermelon. And if you eat one grape, you'd be fine. If you ate an entire watermelon, it can make you very sick. If we look at the grape as the medicine your daughter's taking, again, it's in the same broad family, the amount of drug that your daughter is getting is very small. Uh, and not only that it's not an anabolic steroid, even though it's in the same big family. And what this drug does is actually reduces the inflammation in your daughter's lungs. And-and it doesn't even get absorbed into the body. It only goes to her lungs. And as I said, I wouldn't want your daughter taking a medication that could have the impact of those anabolic steroids. This is really safe for your daughter to use. So what-what are your thoughts about considering having her using this?", "Well, I-I guess I didn't realize that they weren't the same thing as the anabolic steroids.", "Mm-hmm.", "Which are the ones that cause all the problems and everything. So, um, if-if you can assure me that it's not going to have those same side effects and health problems-", "Yeah, def-definitely would not. I mean, probably you saw the name corticosteroid and thought, \"uh-oh.\"", "Yeah.", "You know. And so-- yeah, and that- and that does concern people. But I do want to reassure you that this is medication that only goes to her lungs, and won't get in her body and they're not the same kind of drugs as the ones you're worried about.", "Okay.", "Do you mind if I talk to you a little bit about what your daughter's lungs are like when she's having these inflammations and needing to go to the emergency room?", "Yeah.", "Okay. When-when somebody has asthma, their lungs are like hypersensitive. If I could use an analogy, again, if-if you had the skin burnt off your arm, if somebody brushed up against you before he had the skin burned off your arm, it wouldn't bother you at all. But when the skin's burned off your arm, you literally react to it. Her lungs are exquisitely sensitive. Uh, and like the skin on your arm would be if the skin got burned off. And what this drug can do? This chronic inhaler is reduce the inflammation in her lungs so that her lungs don't remain exquisitely sensitive. Because otherwise, everything in the air like dust, pollen, uh, reacts with her, uh, in ways that it would not normally affect us.", "Oh, okay.", "And so this chronic inhaler can really prevent that from happening. Okay? Which is why it's so important to use it.", "Mm-hmm.", "The other thing I was going to tell you is that, unfortunately, uh, even though you are smoking outside and keeping the smoke away from her, the smoke on your clothes, because her lungs are so sensitive, can also affect her lungs and cause her to have a reaction. Now, something I'd like you to think about is that, if you use the chronic inhaler every day, she may not be sensitive to the smoke on your clothes, but she still maybe because her lungs are just very different than ours. Um, honestly, I'd love to see you quit smoking for you too because, you know, as you know, it's not real good for you.", "Yeah.", "Uh, and it would certainly help her. Um, but what I'd like you to do is to, kind of, keep an eye on what happens when she uses the chronic inhaler. And if she's still flaring up when you're around her, if there are any, if there is smoke on your clothes because it-it can flare her up.", "Oh, even when it's just on my clothes?", "Yeah. Yeah.", "She's that sensitive. If I realized that", "It-it-it-- Yeah. It may not- it may not when she uses the chronic inhaler, uh, but you'll need to keep an eye on that. Obviously, it would be- what would be best if it didn't get on your clothes, or you quit smoking.", "Right. Um, so would it help, um-- You know, the thought of quitting smoking is a pretty daunting aspect.", "Mm-hmm.", "I mean, I know people who've tried to quit and it's-it's just it's- it's really difficult, you know. So I know, it'd be better", "Very hard. It's very relaxing, and-", "Yeah.", "And-and it's hard to replace it with something.", "Yeah, it is. Um.", "So, uh, any thoughts on what you may be able to do to-to help at this point, if you don't choose to quit right away?", "Well, I was thinking, um, if since it, you know, it affects her that it's on my clothes, if I only smoked while she was at school, and then changed my clothes before she came home. Would that help?", "Oh, that-that sounds like it would be great if you were able to do that. Obviously, don't smoke in the house, you know- you know.", "Oh, absolutely. I never. Never.", "Um, so yeah. If you're willing to do that, that certainly would help.", "Okay.", "Uh, again, if you get to the point sometime down the road where you're willing to quit for both you and her, uh, we'd be glad to help you do that. Because you're right it is- it's not an easy thing to do.", "Yeah. [chuckles]", "Okay.", "It's really difficult.", "So it sounds like right now where we are, is you're willing to-to have her use the chronic inhaler to try to get the inflammation down, so she doesn't need to go to the emergency room and do whatever you can at this point to keep the smoke off your clothes. And I think you're gonna see big changes in terms of, uh, her not needing to go to the emergency room, and you probably won't need to use the rescue inhaler hardly at all.", "Oh, really?", "Yeah, because you'll get that inflammation down.", "Oh, that's great-", "Okay.", "-because that's always scary when she has to use that one.", "Yeah. So we'll go ahead and get both of those prescriptions ready.", "Okay.", "Use the chronic inhaler every day, keep the rescue inhaler around if she needs it.
